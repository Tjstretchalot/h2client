    with `stream=None` or `stream=-1`

    Attributes:
    - `conn (Connection)`: The inner-most Conection object this delegates to
    - `events_by_stream (dict[int, deque])`: The events broken down by their
      stream id. The stream id `-1` is used for events without a stream id.
    - `_open_counter (int)`: The number of times that this connection has been
      opened. This allows us to fail read_event_on_stream requests that are
      for previous connections.
    - `_lock (asyncio.Lock)`: The lock used to ensure that we only have one
      active await for reading events. This isn't strictly necessary, but it
      ensures that if our read requests were for stream A then stream B
      but we actually received events from stream B then stream A, as soon as
      we actually receive that first event from stream B we immediately return
      for the second await (rather than waiting on stream As to come in)
