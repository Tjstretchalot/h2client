"""Responsible for wrapping a request connection in http/2 semantics that are
a bit easier to manage, including get/post/put etc. This will treat the body
as bytes, but now those bytes are written to an io object rather than
returned over a series of yields.

This does not perform any higher level logic over the headers, such as the common
helpers for cookies, redirects, and content-type.
